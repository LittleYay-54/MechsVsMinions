# The engine logic shall be contained here.
# Here is the plan:
# the code should be built in a way such that the game is playable through a GUI.
# The engine should *merely make choices on behalf of a would-be player*.
# Therefore, executing command cards should not cause branches themselves,
# instead they should raise some sort of user-input prompt
# which the engine can then "automate"
