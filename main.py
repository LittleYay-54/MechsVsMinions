    # I have functions that will initialize a board state in game_flow.py
    # for every basis list, create a board with the minions and the oil
    # and instantiate a Mech (which automatically places it on the board)

    # you can try to run the engine for each of these, but there are probably a morbillion bugs
    # i'll look at them later unless you can figure out how to fix the code
